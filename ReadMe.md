# DS 2.1 Machine Learning

## Course Description

Students will learn the foundational concepts and techniques of machine learning and how to apply those techniques to data science. Principles of data science and machine learning will be examined and applied to problem solving.  Students will master data science processes and its applications, including how to wrangle and use data to train classification or prediction models. To demonstrate mastery, students will apply these techniques to develop and train models on data sets using industry-standard modern software libraries and tools. Students will develop “sharp” data science questions, select a data set and apply a variety of methods to explore those questions and find relevant answers.

### Why you should know this?

Machine learning has shaped our world. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions.

## Class Assignments
- Apply Linear Regression for Boston Housing Dataset
- Apply SVM for Breast Cancer Dataset
- Apply PCA and K-Means Clustering on wholesale customers dataset
- Projects should be linked to a project page which has a description & requirements.

### Tutorials
- We'll be exploring basic machine learning algorithms applied on to simple datasets with an emphasis on getting basic model functionality
- https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/ds-2-1-classification-tutorial

### Projects
- You will choose your own dataset to clean, investigate, and make predictions or classification or clustering on it

**All projects will require a minimum of 10 commits, and must take place throughout the entirety of the course**

- **Good Example:** 40+ commits throughout the length of the course, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- **Bad Example:** 10 commits on one day during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- **Unacceptable Example:** 2 commits the day before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class.

#### Why are we doing this?

We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer. Breaking up a project by doing a large amount of commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset. Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.

### Final Exam

-  **Passing the exam is a requirement for passing the class.**
- You will have 2 hours to complete this exam - it will be in class using paper and pencil, or a format of the instructor's choosing
- There are no retakes of the exam.
- If you have a disability that needs an accommodation such as extended time or a different format, please take advantage of our [accommodations program](make.sc/disability-policy).

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:
- Should participate for all in-class activities
- Accomplish all the homework
- Finish the course tutorial(s)
- Pass Final Exam >= 75% and Quizzes
- Do final project and present it
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Attend all Programming Labs
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Attendance
 Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions: classes, huddles, etc. and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP will result in not being invited back next term.
